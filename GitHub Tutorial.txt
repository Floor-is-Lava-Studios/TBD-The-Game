Welcome to the very basic GitHub tutorial

1st Step: Create a GitHub Account if for some reason you dont have one
2: download GitHub to your Computer
3:Sign into github on computer

now this is where i am a little fuzzy on instructions 

4. if you don't see TBD-The-Game Repository go to github(the site) look at are team page
   find TBD-The-Game Repository and click Clone in Desktop(the button is on the right side
   the page)
5.Congrats it should now appear on your github on you computer if not ask me when we meet and
 ill get it working

side note:
on gitHub(Site) in the TBD-The-Game there should be a button that says watch or unwatch 
if it says watch click it. This will give you notifications when the repository is changed

Now How To GitHub:
now that you have TBD-The-Game Repository in your github you should be ablle to see the history
of changes made to the repository. as you can see i have made changes to it so if you click on
the change aka the commit called "Added How to Github" you will see that in the GitHub_Tutorial.txt
file i add this text and the entire Github tutorial file to TBD-The-Game Repository.
Heres a key for changes:
Green- means "this stuff was added"
Red- means "this stuff was removed"
No Color- means there was no changed to this stuff

To commit or to uncommit
Ok show basically here is what uncommit and commit mean. if you make a changes in the TBD-The-Game Repository
folder or to a file in that folder, and then go back to your github. click on TBD-The-Game Repository and you
will see uncommited changes above history click show and it will show you what you change in the project.

MOST IMPORTANT PART EEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
IF YOU DO NOT COMMIT YOUR CHANGES NONE OF US WILL SEE THE UPDATED VERSION ON GITHUB AND
THE GITHUB SQUID CAT WILL KILL YOU!!!!!
